            Centralized System
The concept of network computer architecture is evolutionary.
 The origin of the centralized computer dates back to the 1940s.
  During that time host computers were very large and expensive machines,
   like the famous MARK I, ENIAC, and EDVAC, etc.
    Even after computers were commercialized around the 1950s, 
    most computers were “hosted” in highly secured data processing centers,
     and users accessed the host computers through “dumb” terminals
     . By the late 1960s, IBM became a dominant vendor of 
     large-scale computers called a “mainframe” host. In the mid-1970s, 
     minicomputers started challenging mainframe computers.
      In many cases, minicomputers could host applications and
       perform the same functions as mainframes, but with less cost.
        Since the host is the center of this system architecture, 
        it is called a centralized system. In the early 1980s,
         most computers, no matter whether they were 
         large-scale mainframes or smaller minicomputers
          were operated as application hosts, while terminal users
           had limited access to their hosts; in fact, most terminal
            users never have any physical access to host computers.
             Generally speaking, a host is a computer designed fo
             r massive parallel processing of large quantities of 
             information connected with terminals utilized by end users.
              All network services, application executions,
               and database requests are hosted in this computer,
                and all data are stored in this host.

Basically, minicomputers and mainframe computers were the de facto 
standard of enterprise centralized computing systems before 
PCs entered the professional computing area. Figure 1 shows 
a typical centralized system.
